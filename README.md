## Goal of the project
Skin cancer affects thousands of individuals each year, with over 1,000 cases reported annually in Estonia. Early detection significantly increases survival rates. Therefore, our goal is to develop a fast and reliable model to assist in diagnosing skin cancer and potentially reduce the number of its cases.
